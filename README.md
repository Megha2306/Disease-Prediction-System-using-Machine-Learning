# Disease-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning
Project Description:
The "Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning" project aims to
develop an intelligent system that predicts the likelihood of a person having a
particular disease based on various health-related features. The system will
utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data and make
predictions, contributing to early disease detection and proactive healthcare
management.
Project Objectives:
1. Data Collection:
- Gather a diverse dataset containing relevant health features, including but not
limited to age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family
medical history.
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values,
outliers, and ensure data quality.
- Normalize or standardize features to bring them to a consistent scale.
3. Feature Selection:
- Employ feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables
for disease prediction.
- Ensure that selected features contribute significantly to the accuracy of the
machine learning models.

INTERN PROJECT PHASE - 2

4. Model Development:
- Explore and implement various machine learning algorithms such as logistic
regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines for
disease prediction.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Cross-Validation:
- Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalization
performance of the models and mitigate overfitting.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of selected machine learning models to
optimize their performance.
Validation and Testing:
- Conduct extensive testing and validation to ensure the accuracy, reliability,
and robustness of the disease prediction system.
